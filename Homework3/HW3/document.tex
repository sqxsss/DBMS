	\subsection{explore scenario}
	
	1. What is the meaning of these keywords?  \\
	
	\noindent The latter [NOT DEFERRABLE] is default, and means that every time a database modification statement is executed, the constraint is checked immediately afterwards, if the modification could violate the foreign-key constraint. However, if we declare a constraint to be DEFERRABLE, then we have the option of having it wait until a transaction is complete before checking the constraint. We follow the keyword DEFERRABLE by either INITIALLY DEFERRED or INITIALLY IMMEDIATE. In the former case, checking will be deferred to just before each transaction commits. In the latter case, the check will be made immediately after each statement.  \\
	
	\noindent with NOT DEFERRABLE each row is checked at insert/update time  \\
	
	\noindent with DEFERRABLE (currently IMMEDIATE) all rows are checked at the end of the insert/update  \\
	
	\noindent with DEFERRABLE (currently DEFERRED) all rows are checked at the end of the transaction   \\
	
	\noindent 2. Why is the action indicated by the keyword INITIALLY DEFERRED DEFERRABLE needed in the scenario above? What is the problem? How is the problem solved?  \\
	
	\noindent During large transactions involving multiple dependancies it is often difficult to process data efficiently due to the restrictions imposed by the constraints. Problem here is caused by the update of a primary key (PK) which is referenced by foreign keys (FK). For example, table CITY's primary key Country is referenced by Province's Country in the second ALTER statement as well as Country's Code in the first ALTER statement. The primary key columns cannot be updated as this would orphan the dependant tables, and the dependant tables cannot be updated prior to the parent table as this would also make them orphans.   \\
	
	\noindent Traditionally this problem was solved by disabling the foreign key constraints or deleting the original records and recreating them. Since neither of these solutions is particularly satisfactory, Oracle 8i includes support for deferred constraints. So after using the keyword INITIALLY DEFERRED DEFERRABLE just like the usage in the schema file, a deferred constraint is only checked at the point the transaction is commited.  \\
