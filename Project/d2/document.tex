	\section{Quality of the overview and description of the application}
	
	Weather and climate are important factors that determine the normal operation of all sectors of society. Weather usually describes the atmospheric conditions at a certain point or period of time, such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind, and ultraviolet index. Weather data is very important in our daily lives. People change their clothes and daily travel plans according to changes in weather and climate. The collected precipitation and temperature data can be used to prevent natural disasters or disasters such as floods and droughts. In addition, weather and climate play a decisive role in agriculture and aviation. For example, weather conditions determine whether an aircraft can take off on time and which route is the safest and safest to choose. At the same time, the construction industry also needs weather data to arrange construction plans and programs. The long-term collection of weather data is of great significance for summarizing the meteorological conditions of the region and predicting the climate change trend in the region. \\
	
	\noindent Nowadays, there are many ways to collect weather data, from large weather radars to small weather stations, which are recording weather data all the time. In view of the importance of weather data, how to properly process and utilize these data has become an important topic. However, using paper data to record and analyze weather data is very cumbersome, inefficient, and unreliable. In addition, the paper-based data recording method is not convenient for storage and quick query. Therefore, we use the Oracle database to design a Weather Recording System. \\
	
	\noindent With the help of a web-based user interface, the system can store these large amounts of weather data in a structured manner and display these data publicly. For different users, you can use this system to operate on weather data according to different needs. In addition, the administrator can also update the data. This database system makes it possible to store a large amount of weather data with high security and long-term storage and at the same time improve the ease of use of the data. \\
	
	\noindent Here is the descripton of the system. The weather recording system needs users to sign up or login to the system. Our system also has an administrator accout to manage users. To the fuctions that showing the data: firstly, Our system will show the basic weather data like temperature, precipitation and so on in the form of table, and users could choose the time period as well as the cities to get the data they want. The second function is that users can know about the information of the weather stations and cities from which our system get the weather data from. What's more, we have five interesting and complex trend queries which will be described in detail in section 2. Users will get the information that is derived from the basic data to be showed in different kinds of charts, for example, they can learn about the change of temperature over a long time period or compare the precipitation at different cities during the same year.

	\section{Quality of the user interface design including the application-specific network or graph of web pages and the  integration of the complex trend queries}
	
	\subsection{Design of the application-specific network}
	
	The system is started from the web page of login, which is showed in the Figure 1. Then, we have three different conditions. The first is when the account that entered is administrator, the system will go to the page that is particularly designed for the administrator to manage all the user. At userManage page, the administrator can delete user, modify user information (Administrator is not allowed to change user's password) or check out the statistics of the number of new user. The second condition is that when the user needs to sign up and create a new account, the system will be directed to the page which is designed for creating new account. At this page, the user only need to enter username and password to create a new account, and after the creation, the web page will direct to the welcome page automatically. The third condition is the most common condition, the user login with his/her username and password correctly, then they will see the welcome page. We currently decide to use the temperature data form of basic data to be the welcome page of out system. The welcome page has several fuctions, users can get to the basic data page, station information page, city information page and trend queries page. Exactly, we are going to put all these parts in a side-menu, so that the users can get to each part from every page. What's more, users can also click on the sign of head portrait and go to the userInfo page at which users could change their names and passwords. After making sure to change, the administrator will get the notice of change.

	\section{Quality of the conceptual database design based on the Entity-Relationship Model and a careful analysis of the deployed data sources}
	
	\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{ER-Diagram}
		\label{fig:er}
	\end{figure}
	
	According to the overall design of the system and the functional modules described above, we selected daily weather data from multiple cities from NOAA.gov. We selected a large number of data files based on the city name to construct the database to be used in the system. The data is selected by selecting cities, time periods and statistical methods. In this data set, the historical weather data of each city comes from weather stations in different locations in the city. For each weather station, it is determined by its name, and a detailed geographic location consisting of latitude, longitude and altitude. The data file composition of each city is roughly the same. According to our classification of entities, weather data can be classified into evaporation, precipitation, wind, air temperature, water, and weather types. \\
	
	\noindent Evaporation, which often used in meteorology to compare with precipitation. The comparative data is important to illustrate how dry and wet a place is. It includes attributes such as Daily maximum temperature of water in an evaporation pan (MXPN), Daily minimum temperature of water in an evaporation pan (MNPN), and Evaporation of water from evaporation pan (EVAP). The units of MXPN and MNPN are degrees Fahrenheit, and the unit of EVAP is inches. \\
	
	\noindent Precipitation refers to the depth of liquid or solid (melted) water that falls from the sky to the ground within a certain period of time, without evaporation, infiltration, or loss, but the depth that it accumulates on the horizontal surface. It includes the commonly used Multiday precipitation total (use with DAPR and DWPR, if available) (MDPR), Number of days included in the multiday precipitation total (MDPR) (DAPR), Precipitation (PRCP), Snow depth (SNWD), Snowfall (SNOW). The units of PRCP, SNWD and SNOW are all inches. \\
	
	\noindent Wind includes attributes like Average wind speed (AWND), Direction of fastest 2-minute wind (WDF2), Direction of fastest 5-second wind (WDF5), Fastest 2-minute wind speed (WSF2), Fastest 5-second wind speed (WSF5). The units of AWND, WSF2 and WSF5 are miles per hour, and the units of WDF2 and WDF5 are degrees.  \\
	
	\noindent Air temperature is composed of Average Temperature. (TAVG), Maximum temperature (TMAX), Minimum temperature (TMIN), Temperature at the time of observation (TOBS). Their units are all degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, we can easily calculate the temperature difference through TMAX and TMIN, which can be used as a derived attribute.   \\
	
	\noindent Water is mainly described by Water equivalent of snow on the ground (WESD), Water equivalent of snowfall (WESF), in inches.   \\
	
	\noindent The ‘**’ in Weather types (WT**) consists of several fixed values, and each value represents a different weather type. For details, please refer to the table below. \\
