	\section{Exercise 4}
	
	\noindent 1. The term is not correct in general. Only when $A_{1}\sqsubseteq A_{2}\sqsubseteq A_{3}...\sqsubseteq A_{n}$ the statement is true.\\
	
	\noindent Proof: \\
	
	\noindent We assume that the relation R have the schema $R(X_{1}:D_{1},X_{2}:D_{2},...,X_{3}:D_{n})$, let two subsets $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$($\exists i,j, 1\le i,j\le n $ and $i<j$). Assume that $A_{i}$ has several attributes, $A_{i}(X_{a}, X_{b}, X_{c}...)$ and $A_{j}$ also have several attributes $A_{j}(X_{x}, X_{y}, X_{z}...)$. Then we consider about the statement $\pi_{A_{i}}(\pi_{A_{j}}(R)) = \pi_{A_{i}}(R)$.\\
	
	\noindent Since all of the attributes of $A_{j}$ are contained in $R$, so the result $R'$ of $\pi_{A_{j}}(R)$ is the same schema as $A_{j}$, then we have $\pi_{A_{i}}(R')$. However, there might be different results according to the relation between $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$.\\
	
	(1) if all of the attributes of $A_{i}$ are not contained in $A_{j}$, it is obvious that $\pi_{A_{i}}(R') = \emptyset$. So the statement won't be true.\\
	
	(2) if some of the attributes of $A_{i}$ are not contained in $A_{j}$, it is also obvious that there won't be any results for $\pi_{A_{i}}(R')$. So the statement is not true.\\
	
	(3) if all of the attributes of $A_{i}$ are contained in $A_{j}$, then the result of $\pi_{A_{i}}(R')$: $R''$  has the same schema as $\pi_{A_{i}}(R)$. So the statement is true.\\
	
	\noindent To conclude, only when all of the attributes of $A_{i}$ are contained in $A_{j}$, which is $A_{i}\sqsubseteq A_{j}$, then $\pi_{A_{i}}(\pi_{A_{j}}(R)) = \pi_{A_{i}}(R)$.\\
	
	\noindent It is also the same when we consider the term of the problem, only when $A_{i}$ is contained by $A_{j}$, for $\forall i,j, 1\le i<j\le n$, which is $A_{1}\sqsubseteq A_{2}\sqsubseteq A_{3}...\sqsubseteq A_{n}$, then the term will be true.\\
	
	
	\noindent 2. Only when all of the attribute names contained in $F$ are also contain in $A$, the statement is true.\\
	
	\noindent Proof: \\
	
	\noindent We assume that relation A has the schema $A(A_{i},..., A_{j})$, in which $\forall i,j, 1\le i<j\le n$, and the set of attributes which names are involved in F: $B(A_{k}, A_{l}...)$.\\
	
	(1) if all of the attributes in B are not included in A, then there will be no result for $\sigma_{F}(\pi_{A}(R))$. \\
	
	(2) if some of the attributes in B are not included in A, then there will also be no result for $\sigma_{F}(\pi_{A}(R))$. \\
	
	(3) if all of the attributes in B are included in A, then the schema of $\sigma_{F}(\pi_{A}(R))$ and $\pi_{A}(\sigma_{F}(R))$ will be the same. What's more, since all of the attribute name in F are contained in A, there is no difference in tuples between them.\\
	
	\noindent To conclude, only when all of the attribute names contained in $F$ are also contain in $A$, the statement is true.\\
	
	\noindent 3. a. We consider $R(A, B)\cup T(A, B)$\\
	
	Maximum: when R and T don't have duplicate tuples, which is $R\cap T=\emptyset$, then the number is r+s.\\
	
	Minimum:\\
	
	(1) $R=T$, then the result is r, s;\\
	
	(2) $R\sqsubseteq T$, then the result is s;\\
	
	(3) $T\sqsubseteq R$, then the result is r;\\
	
	As a result, the minimum number of tuples is $max(r, s)$.\\
	
	\noindent b. Exactly, $R\bowtie R=R$, then we can know $R\bowtie(R\bowtie R)=R$. \\
	
	To conclude, Minimum is r and Maxmum is also r.\\
	
	\noindent c. To consider $\pi_{A, C}(R\bowtie S)$, we can consider the result of $R\bowtie S$. \\
	
	Maximum: when all the values of B in either R and S are same, which means $\vert\pi_{B}(R)\vert=\vert\pi_{B}(S)\vert=1$, then $\vert R\bowtie S\vert$ will be the maximum, so the maximum number is $r\cdot s$.\\
	
	Minimum: when $R\bowtie S=\emptyset$. there will be no result for projection, so the minimum is 0.\\
	
	\noindent d. To consider $\sigma_{A=C}(R\bowtie S)$, we can also consider the result of $R\bowtie S$. \\
	
	Maximum: when all the values of B in either R and S are same, which means $\vert\pi_{B}(R)\vert=\vert\pi_{B}(S)\vert=1$, then the maximum number is depend on the minimum of $\vert\pi_{A}(R)\vert$ and $\vert\pi_{C}(S)\vert$. As a result, the maximum number is $min(r, s)$.\\
	
	Minimum: \\
	
	(1) when $R\bowtie S=\emptyset$, there will be no result for projection, so the minimum is 0.\\
	
	(2) There is another situation, although $R\bowtie S\neq\emptyset$, there is no tuple $A=C$.\\
	
	To conclude, the minimum number is 0.
